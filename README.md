 Simulated Cloud Storage with Local Directory (No Card Access)
Since I currently do not have access to a credit or debit card, I was unable to activate real cloud storage services such as AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage, which require billing information even for free-tier accounts.

Instead, I have simulated the behavior of cloud storage within this Replit environment using a local directory named my_bucket.

✅ What This Simulation Includes:
📁 Creating a bucket-like folder structure (my_bucket/)

📄 Listing files inside the bucket

📖 Reading file contents from files within the bucket
